### HW 5. Clustering algorithms 


#### Goal:  
- can implement and configure the clustering algorithms.
- can provide the reasons why the chosen algorithm is the most suitable for given datasets. 
- can provide the answer with evidence.

We have provided parts of the implementation in Github Lab5. The hyperparameters were not only roughly set up, so you may need to find the best  settings on your own.  

#### Assignment sheet  

Download the [Google doc: Lab5](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8ZRV82h77Vwxc1H-u_OzqdHPrGLDGJwGSPyFx42M9M/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.umlmb4qd3y4r) and answer all the questions. 


- Explore the given datasets dataset A and dataset B. At first, you should try different clustering algorithms (k-mean, GMM, and DBSCAN) on dataset A.  We have provided parts of the implementation in Github Lab5. The hyperparameters were only roughly  set up, so you may need to find the most suitable setting on your own.  Also, we provided the ground truth clusters in the attribute called `label’ in the dictionary (for both dataset A and B). Then, answer the following questions:

    - 1. When the number of clusters is unknown, what is the most suitable algorithm  (including the hyperparameter settings) ? Also, provide the reasons why the chosen algorithm is the most suitable for given datasets

    - 2. However, when the number of clusters is known, what is the most suitable algorithm  (including the hyperparameter settings) ? Provide the reasons why the chosen algorithm is the most suitable for given datasets

- If you switch to  dataset B, would you get the same answers? And why?
