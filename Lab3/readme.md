 Our goal is to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of lectures in **Statiscal Learning EE2102575** by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.


### Outlier analysis and regularization 
   
  This notebook provides:  
  
  - Tools and packages
  - Download student depression dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset) 
  - Data processing

  - Your tasks are 
    - 1. [logistic regression notebook](logistic_regression.ipynb) provides how early stopper works.    
    - 2. [main notebook](main.ipynb) provides a training for neural network with early stopper. 
        - Explain how you will extend this notebook to select the different neural network configurations by varying the number of layers to 1, 2, 3.     
        - Provide F1 / BCE loss curves versus the number of layers. 
        - Show how to select the number of layers using the F1 / BCE loss curves vs. the number of layers.    
        - Provide your answer here [Google doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yd3etwo5Di_udjXMxGutus34x6QzpV8Q-hruVncHNnY/edit?usp=sharing)
