 Our goal is to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of lectures in **Statiscal Learning EE2102575** by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.


### Outlier analysis and regularization 
   
  This notebook provides:  
  
  - Tools and packages
  - Download student depression dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset) 
  - Data processing

  - Your tasks are 
    - 1. [logistic regression notebook](logistic_regression.ipynb) <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GenAI-CUEE/Statistical-Learning-EE575-Y2024/blob/master/Lab3/logistic_regression.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/> provides how early stopper works.    
    
    

    - 2. [main notebook](main.ipynb) <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GenAI-CUEE/Statistical-Learning-EE575-Y2024/blob/master/Lab3/main.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/> provides a training for neural network with early stopper.  
    
        - Explain how you will extend this notebook to select the different neural network configurations by varying the number of layers to 1, 2, 3.     
        - Provide F1 / BCE loss curves versus the number of layers. 
        - Show how to select the number of layers using the F1 / BCE loss curves vs. the number of layers.
