 Our goal is to provide the code-based visualization and exercises to understand the mathematics behind each of lectures in **Statiscal Learning EE2102575** by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul*.


### Outlier analysis and regularization 
   
  This notebook provides:  
  
  - Tools and packages
  - Download data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) 
  - Data processing

  - Your tasks are 
    
    1. Complete 2 outlier analysises: [Lab 2: Outlier diagnostics](outlier_diagnostics.ipynb)        <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GenAI-CUEE/Statistical-Learning-EE575-Y2024/blob/master/Lab2/outlier_diagnostics.ipynb"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
      </a>

      - H-matrix    
      - Cook's distance  

    2. Complete all the questions in the lab report provided in [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-dJQiSUfh7xgOnS_mmyO56fu2aH97bs2UKa3ktmkDko/edit?usp=sharing]

      - Q1. Point out the differences between H-matrix and Cook's distance in the algorithm that can lead to the different results. 
      - Q2. Provides 3 different ways to improve the results from these two methods.      
      - Please answer these questions using your results in Lab2 to provide the discussion. Make sure that every point that you made is supported by the evidence and the data.
    
    - Don't forget to rename "outlier_diagnostics.ipynb"  to "G1.ipynb"  (if you are in group no. 1) and submit it together with your lab report through `Assignemnts` (myCourseVille).
