  This notebook provides:  
  - Tools and packages
  
  - Download data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) 
  - Data processing

  - Your tasks are 
    
    1. Complete 2 outlier analysises:
      - H-matrix    
      - Cook's distance  

    2. Submit a lab report 
      - Point out the differences between H-matrix and Cook's distance in the algorithm that can lead to the different results. 
      - Provides 3 different ways to improve the results from these two methods.      
  
    - Rename "outlier_diagnostics.ipynb"  to "G1.ipynb"  (if you are in group no. 1) and submit it together with your lab report through `Assignemnts` (myCourseVille).
