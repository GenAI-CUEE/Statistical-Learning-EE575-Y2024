## Tutorial 5: Support vector machine

by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Ph.D.*

Support `Lecture 12: Support vector machine` ... 

In this tutorial, we will build SVM for binary-class classification.  

In this experiment, we will investigate 
  - (a) how the learned model has changed as the regularization parameter $C$ increased or decreased ( C = 1000 vs. C = 0.001)... This can be explained by showing the differences in the support hyperplanes and the target hyperplane. 

  - (b) how the performance on the test data looks like as the regularization parameter $C$ increased or decreased 

  - You can provide your results in the lab sheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWBvb9OQFmyp9sb9t6UMkYqNuXfTGSRJpQ4XxbNP_WY/edit?usp=sharing
