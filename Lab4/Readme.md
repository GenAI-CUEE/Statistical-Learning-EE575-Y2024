### HW 4. Support vector machine
#### Goal: 
  - can implement SVM and train the model.
  - can use the evaluation metrics and validation techniques for choosing the best configuration of the hyperparameters in SVM.  

#### Assignment sheet  

Download the [Google doc: Lab3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yd3etwo5Di_udjXMxGutus34x6QzpV8Q-hruVncHNnY/edit?tab=t.0) and answer all the questions. \


In this experiment, we will investigate 
  - (a) how the learned model has changed as the regularization parameter $C$ increased or decreased ( C = 1000 vs. C = 0.001)... This can be explained by showing the differences in the support hyperplanes and the target hyperplane. 

  - (b) how the performance on the test data looks like as the regularization parameter $C$ increased or decreased 

  - You can provide your results in the lab sheet: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lWBvb9OQFmyp9sb9t6UMkYqNuXfTGSRJpQ4XxbNP_WY/edit?usp=sharing
